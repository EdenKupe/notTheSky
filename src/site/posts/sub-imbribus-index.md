Sub Imbribus (Latin for "under heavy rains") is my ode to one of my favorite forces of nature: rain. It is a science fiction short story suite. It is a work in progress. It follows a society from its inception as a space colony, through its fall, and its resurgence. Not always in a linear fashion. When I finish it, I'll probably include a more fleshed out timeline here. Or not. Anyway, here's a poem:

"Mother rain, manifold, measureless,
falling on fallow, on field and forest,
on house-roof, low hovel, high tower,
downwelling waters all-washing, wider
than cities, softer than sisterhood, vaster
than countrysides, calming, recalling:
return to us, teaching our troubled
souls in your ceaseless descent
to fall, to be fellow, to feel to the root,
to sink in, to heal, to sweeten the sea."

- Ursula K. Le Guin, "To the Rain"
