Here's what you're going to do:</br></br>
you're going to come back home</br>
to your not-so-small town</br>
from the big city,</br>
the biggest city there is,</br>
and you're going to walk to the gym,</br>
walk, don't drive</br>
and don't run</br>
walk</br>
and give it your all</br>
and when your body is tired</br>
you're going to walk back</br>
oh, did I mention you'll also move</br>
to a northern town?</br>
not too north but still</br>
much norther than you've lived at before</br>
except those two years, twenty five years ago,</br>
just a bit to the south of that</br></br>
where the June light goes all the way to nine</br>
but not quite to midnight</br>
and in that light you're going to walk home</br>
and the street will smell like your grandmother's kitchen.</br>
you're going to realize how much she meant to you</br>
although you don't think she knew but</br>
you're going to hope, you're going to believe she did</br>
she knew what a mainstay she was and,</br>
as you think these thoughts,</br>
you're going to play a song</br>
any song that brings you to tears and,</br>
in the quickening breeze of a June evening,</br>
you're going to cry.</br>
you're going to cry a not-so-sad cry</br>
tears for streets you'll never walk down again</br>
and things you won't be able to tell your grandmother</br>
like "i know it's not your fault" and "thank you for everything".</br>
and before the tears dry</br>
you'll be home and</br>
here's what you're going to do:</br>
you're going to feel the fatigue drain from your legs</br>
and you're going to kiss your wife</br>
and you're going to write this poem</br>
and you're going to be sorry for your grandmother</br>
who really did love a lot of people</br>
but maybe didn't quite know how to show it</br>
beyond cooking for them and nagging them and</br>
telling them that they're very smart</br>
without a shard of pretense</br>
like the others had</br>
and you're going to love her</br>
and regret a lot.</br>
and then here's what you're going to do:</br>
you're going to finish this poem</br>
and eat something</br>
and you're going to be happy</br>
