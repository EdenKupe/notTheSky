Be!

Between the fingers, the blades of grass
slither, a delicate rhythm that sends
a code that whispers:
"be joyful!"

On the skin, the skeins of wind
mingle, a beautiful dance that sends
a message that sings:
"be free!"

All around me, the hums of silence
descend, a wondrous orchestra that creates
a longing that urges:
"be open!"

Far from me, the horizon
is, pierced by my gaze that creates
a song that says:
"be!"
