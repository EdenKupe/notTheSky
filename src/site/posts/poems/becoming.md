Maybe if I live long enough</br>
I will find out why, upon hearing barking from around the corner</br>
I think about becoming.</br>
Honestly though, I don't think a life,</br>
as joyous and long and exuberant as a life might be,</br>
could ever be enough to answer that question.</br>

But to come to the beginning of an understanding</br>
as to why each snowflake seems to move so slow</br>
but when you focus on one of them,</br>
one seemingly lazy dancer in the whole,</br>
it suddenly seems to zoom so fast</br>
catching the light of the street lamp and</br>
turning into a comet.</br>
Some sort of beginning of an understanding here</br>
might be reached before you die.</br>

Meanwhile, there's the weirdly lit color of the sky,</br>
as if the sun were escaping the day's snowfall</br>
at something less than its infamously fixed speed.</br>
Meanwhile there is the memory of whatever it was I saw in the clouds</br>
the day I landed here.</br> Meanwhile there is the memory</br>
of laughter on a bench, probably uprooted by now.</br>

The bench, not the laughter, of course as</br>
I'm pretty sure there is no uprooting laughter.</br>
Just like there's no uprooting the barking</br>
from around the corner.</br>
