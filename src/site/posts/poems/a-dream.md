Ends, none are evident.
The plain rises fully when
the moon stretches into an infinite
field of glittering sable. By my side,
you smile and in the face of the cold,
inch closer.

My eyes lose focus and the mixing
of purple and silver sings.
The Keplerian music, divine or not,
suffuses the moment. Turning to you, I
smile and my dream-ends
inch closer.
