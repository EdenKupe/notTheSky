Of Rain

This is a simple truth:
thoughts of man are made
of dust. Temporary does not
begin to describe them.

This is a tricky truth:
words of man are made
of mercury. Unstable does not
begin to unwind them.

This is a cruel truth:
lives of man are made
of iron. Harsh does not
begin to erode them.

This is a deep truth:
songs of man are made
of rain. Mending does not
begin to fill them.
