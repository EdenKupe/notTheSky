Hands taut, I attempt again;
to breathe underwater.
Neck stretched, I am on the hunt;
to catch a strand of fragrance.

When I realize that the veil has lifted,
it is already too late.
Sight shivering, I attempt again;
to make sense of koans.

Heart hammering, I am in the dance;
to catch a brief embrace.
When I realize that the music has begun,
I am already too late.

Mouth-watering, I attempt again;
to sound a perfect note.
Eyes-tearing, I am at wonder;
to hear a quickening beat.

When I realize that the arms are open,
I am already there.
Love warming, I succeed again;
I am a particle.

Truth knowing, I am at peace;
I am the madrigal.
When I realize that I'm crying,
I am already smiling.
