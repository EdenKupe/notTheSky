Someone's yard goes all the way up to the train tracks<br>
So a kid grows up with the scythe edge of a train's screech 
slicing through the night<br>
It's not a bad sound but it's a big sound<br>
Filling up his dreams with distance

Down the street<br>
The Junk King quilts together dormant sheets of metal into purpose<br>
Her sweat drips, earthy and marble-rich,<br>
To be swallowed up by retreating rust

The kid meanwhile is now an adult and,
in between day jobs and barely realized dates,<br>
He still dreams of the iron cormorants<br>
Slicing away at a sable, cloud-mottled sky

The hum of the city blankets him through sleep<br>
And the vibrating puddles in the street outside<br>
Sing them, longingly, to home.
