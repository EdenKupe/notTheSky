Imagine being a dog</br>
and cresting the hill before a park;</br>
the entire city stretching beneath you,</br>
a mesmeration of scent, a topography of light,</br>
more news and rumors and fact</br>
than are hidden in any core of an orbiting satellite.</br>

I got a new kitchen set yesterday</br>
and held it in my hands, feeling</br>
all the dishes it will one day hold.</br>
Plastic, yes, and tin and wood and</br>
cloying, effective rubber</br>
but also light and heat</br>
and salt and fire</br>
and thought.</br>

Imagine being a dog</br>
and making a turn you've never made before;</br>
a shoulder of street unwinding before you,</br>
a murmuring of hedgegrows, a bundling of life,</br>
more sounds and struggles and speed</br>
than are written in any history of strife.</br>

I got a new kitchen set yesterday</br>
and tucked it away into cupboards, imagining</br>
distant kingdoms in the woodwork.</br>
Ants, yes, and roaches and mites and</br>
expanding, ancient air</br>
but also shadow and breeze</br>
and sawdust and webs</br>
and peace.</br>

Imagine being a dog.</br>
And imagine getting a kitchen set.</br>
Imagine walking down a street.</br>
And imagine tucking things into cupboards.</br>
Imagine the world dead.</br>
And, most of all, imagine the world alive.</br>
