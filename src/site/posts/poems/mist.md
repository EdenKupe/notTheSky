The past rises like a mist and,</br>
listen, I am sorry to say that</br>
you will regret most of this. The snaking arms</br>
of water smashed upon the rocks continue to ascend</br>
and who you were flees under your gaze.</br>

Like a rabbit, it shudders here and there</br>
forever hounded by your strigine glare.</br>
From its flanks, flashing white in the iced over snow</br>
rise the mists from which you grow.</br>

The past unfurls like a dawn and,</br>
listen, I am sorry so say that</br>
you will grow distant from most of this. The snaking arms</br>
of light perforating the clouds continue to ascend</br>
and who you were soars above your gaze.</br>

Like a robin, it flutters here and there</br>
forever escaping your sanguine glare.</br>
From its wings, flashing red in the branches of a winter abused tree</br>
rise the mists which set you free.</br>

Alas, the past coalesces like a face and,</br>
listen, I am sorry to say that</br>
you will not recognize it. The snaking arms</br>
of decisions writ upon the skin continue to meander</br>
and who you were collapses before your gaze.</br>

Like a memory, it stutters here and there</br>
forever morphing under your desperate glare.</br>
From its vapors, never-captured amidst the crackling chill</br>
rise the mists which haunt you still.</br>
