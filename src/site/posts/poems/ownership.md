Have you watered the tree with your own saliva?</br>
Bled into the flower bed, nails torn off,</br>
plasma roiling into the manured dirt,</br>
eddies of earth and dust and rust-red liquid,</br>
freed at last from imaginary boundaries,</br>
mixing in the pot, a tellurian elixir.</br>

Have you lost your breath on the mountainside?</br>
Shed moisture into the cold air, soft tissue hurting,</br>
lungs churning with ice-clad blades,</br>
whirlwinds of water and frost and black-blue liquid,</br>
rushing at last from imaginary boundaries,</br>
mixing in your body, a mercurial solution.</br>

Have you dripped your sweat on the asphalt?</br>
Spilt salt on the black tarmac, skin itching,</br>
cells walls circling amidst tenuous flows,</br>
pools of sediment and acid and clear liquid,</br>
sloughing at last from imaginary boundaries,</br>
blending on the ground, an alkaline potion.</br>

If you haven't, watered and lost and dripped I mean,</br>
then don't talk to me of ownership,</br>
of justice metted out or withdrawn or broken,</br>
debts owed or treasures gained,</br>
memories forgotten.</br>
