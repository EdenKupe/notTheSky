This hour
This hour
When the sun begins to set and
the deep door to the well of memory opens
When then and now blend and
yesterday and yesteryear and in a minute are the same

This hour
This hour
When the sun begins to set and
the crystal warm stream of feeling gushes
When the minute and the monumental blend and
tomorrow and today and never-forever are the same

This hour
This hour
When the sun begins to set and
the velvet valves of the gut set the lips open
When here and there blend and
soon and later and afterwards are the same

This hour
This day
This week
This year
This life
With you
