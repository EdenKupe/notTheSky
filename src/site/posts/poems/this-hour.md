This hour<br>
This hour<br>
When the sun begins to set and<br>
the deep door to the well of memory opens<br>
When then and now blend and<br>
yesterday and yesteryear and in a minute are the same<br>

This hour<br>
This hour<br>
When the sun begins to set and<br>
the crystal warm stream of feeling gushes<br>
When the minute and the monumental blend and<br>
tomorrow and today and never-forever are the same<br>

This hour<br>
This hour<br>
When the sun begins to set and<br>
the velvet valves of the gut set the lips open<br>
When here and there blend and<br>
soon and later and afterwards are the same<br>

This hour<br>
This day<br>
This week<br>
This year<br>
This life<br>
With you<br>
