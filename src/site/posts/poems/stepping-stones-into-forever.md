See, with your eyes which are rapiers, the moons
scattered among the stars. These stepping stones into
forever softly speak our story. Oh, wondrous syllables,
oh, unspeakable cadences,  hear them echo in comfort
across the spaces of my heart.

We are alike two solar empires, vibrant, pulsing roads
into the impossibility of space. The silk of our roads is
the lifeblood of civilizations, the knowledge of languages,
the *limes* of understanding. Lying in the darkness, they trade
the smooth, ion-fueled markings of love.

See, with your eyes which are sabers, the planets
embedded between the stars. These stepping stones into
forever softly unfold our hymn. Oh, sonorous letters,
oh, mellifluous stanzas, catch them echo in joy
across the star-charts of my mind.

We are alike two intergalactic councils, lively, silent beacons
anchored in the impossibility of space. The bells of our prayer are
the humming of commerce, the manuscripts of wisdom,
the borders of empathy. Shining in the darkness, they exchange
the intangible, ion-fueled markings of love.

See, with your eyes which are like *épées*, the only truth which
shall escape the hunger of black holes;
shall outlast the burning of fusion-stars;
shall imbibe the sickness of forever engines;
shall bind the passion of terran empires;
the stepping stones into forever.
