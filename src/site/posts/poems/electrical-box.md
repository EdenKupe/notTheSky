The electrical box, on its side, reads "potion?"</br>
and the park's swings each hold a softly swinging body </br>
like a globule of</br>
warmth. Elsewhere,</br>
rabbits buzz across the flaking concrete</br>
and the soft careening of lives</br>
pulses from within houses.

I ask you what love is for and you,</br>
lithely smiling from within me,</br>
throw some quote from the old Japanese book at me.</br>
I know that's not your answer</br>
but the words still goad me.</br>

The electrical box, all around, is encased in plastic</br>
and the street's corners each caress a softly breathing body</br>
like a spindle of</br>
breath. Elsewhere,</br>
bees hum around the window</br>
and the coruscating stories of lives</br>
unfold inside houses.

I insist and demand you tell me what love is for and you,</br>
shrugging into the space you hold within me,</br>
finally relent and say:</br>
"why, it is to find out what the next poem sounds like</br>
you absolute fool".
