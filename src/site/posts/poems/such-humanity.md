There is such humanity
to burst on this place and
unwittingly make it into a
butterfly.

With gems and twinklings
of the end of things
we decorate the memorabilia
of the future.

There is such humanity
to dance through this place
and unwittingly take it as
a forest.

With songs and shards
of the sadness of things
we paint the records
of the future.

There is such humanity
to sleep inside this place
and unwittingly dream it
a home.

With tears and glimmerings
of the truth of things
we draw the plans
of the future.
