Spring equinox,</br>
or near enough as not to matter,</br>
in the mega-city and all around me</br>
I can feel the tree-currents of real and abstract power</br>
swirl.

I see a kid,</br>
eating a cookie from a place I like,</br>
and can't help but think "fuck!</br>
he was fucking born into all of this".</br>

But of course I was born into all of this too,</br>
all of us were,</br>
ever since the parochial walls came down,</br>
and the seed-currents' flow became all.</br>

"Trying to hold a poem in",</br>
I think to myself,</br>
"is liking trying not to cum</br>
as you stand on the precipice</br>
internally gushing".</br>

Meanwhile, the homeless person</br>
suffers the wounds of Christ and,</br>
another cold night ahead,</br>
snuggles close to the black of the cigarette-brushed asphalt,</br>
and murmurs: all that is gold fades into air</br>
