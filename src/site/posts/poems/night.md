Some say you are a lover
and chase you with silken words. 
They long to embrace you and
run themselves off dripping roofs. 

Some shout you are a madness
and flee you with gilded footsteps. 
They seek to escape you and
bury themselves in golden arcs. 

Some think you are a master 
and worship you with aching minds. 
They seek to un-chain you and
waste themselves in futile lines. 

But I, I know you for the night
and listen to you with all my heart. 
I seek to drink you and
become my own light.
