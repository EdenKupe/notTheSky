I'm sorry that it's true that,</br>
one day, you will no longer be able</br>
to ask your mother what kind of plants</br>
would work best in the corner of your room.</br>
Your dad will no longer be there to converse</br>
on the folly of trusting your brain and the elaborate</br>
audio-visual display that it conjures at will.</br>

I'm also sorry that it's true that,</br>
one day, your dog will start taking slower and slower walks</br>
until, in a white-washed room awash in fluorescent light,</br>
they lie down for one last good nap.</br>
And also, the racoon you once saw is probably also dead and,</br>
in general, the entire biomass that is the track record of your existence</br>
your traipse through this world, is more already-dead than not.</br>

However! I am also ecstatic to report that,</br>
for so long that it might as well be</br>
forever, </br>
rains will fall on the ocean shore</br>
and winds will blow down that street you know</br>
populated as it might be by people or by fierce, unstoppable vines.</br>
And also,</br>
even when the sun's nuclear engine stills and</br>
comets are all that plays in her steady, mathematical, assured orbits,</br>
you will have existed</br>
and ceased</br>
and that's something beautiful</br>
to have been present but also</br>
to one day be absent</br>
to have learned to live and then,</br>
maybe, hopefully, before it came,</br>
to have learned to die.</br>

So, it's true that all things shall pass but</br>
that also means that the fist</br>
will one day unclench and</br>
that all itches shall be scratched</br>
and yes, all poems lost, and language itself turn to dust</br>
and bright, impossible lights be struck down like a swarm of bugs</br>
but also that</br>
pain will cease and</br>
all crying ends</br>
and</br>
