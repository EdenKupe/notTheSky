From the shadows that are birthed
from the flames that are birthed
from the torches that are birthed
from the thoughts that are birthed
by pain wafts a strong smell of
discarded dreams.

Into the tears that are wrought
from the rivers that are wrought
from the passes that are wrought
from the needs that are wrought
by desire works a harsh echo of
beggared hopes.

Out of the sparks that are learned
from the lights that are learned
from the suns that are learned
from the loves that are learned
by my fire springs the laughter of
becoming me.
