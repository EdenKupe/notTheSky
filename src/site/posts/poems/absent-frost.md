At the far reaches of my hearing</br>
a police siren pulses into the night</br>
for no good reason, I suspect, while</br>
some critter rustles in the bush next to me</br>
catching me off guard.</br>

Suddenly, as if from a time when</br>
day never ended</br>
the cry of a hawk pierces the night.</br>
Elsewhere, the high-school field sits green,</br>
dreaming of absent frost.</br>

What a strange thing it is,</br>
to be human and awake at night,</br>
a life where every corner,</br>
every flagstone, every garage door,</br>
can be the subject of a poem.</br>
