Let me tell you a story.</br>
Let it be a story about knights.</br>
Being a story about knights,</br>
let it also, naturally, be about courage.</br>
Let one knight be called Time.</br>
Let the other be called Soap.</br>
And let them fight.</br>

First, Time emerges to their list,</br>
armor all purple and gloaming.</br>
Brandishing a wicked sword, Time</br>
runs through its motions,</br>
every slice a riposte that sings</br>
with ill-intent.</br>

Then, Soap comes to their lane,</br>
straddling nothing but the wind itself.</br>
Weaving in time with their breath, Soap</br>
charts its subtle dance,</br>
every turn an intimation of</br>
a time where you were easy.</br>

Now the two knights come forth</br>
and meet in the middle. "Lo!" cries Time,</br>
"I am Time and I am come to end this thing</br>
as I end all that is!" and Soap,</br>
hunching their shoulders,</br>
replies "I am Soap and I am come to undo you".</br>

Time stands back. They adjust their sable pauldrons.</br>
"Perhaps I misheard", Time intones,</br>
"for I swear that you just challenged me!</br>
Fool! I am Time! I bear the weight of all memory,</br>
I am the brother of grief! I am the sister of defeat!</br>
I weigh the world against a feather and find it wanting!"</br>

Soap smiles. "Well, I</br>
I smell like childhood.</br>
And I feel like care. I</br>
feel like your grandmother</br>
telling you to wash behind your ears.</br>
I taste of yesterday and tomorrow and forever.</br>
For me, there is no lock; I work my way through wood.</br>
I run past stone and leave it cleaner. To meet me</br>
is to meet someone who loves you and,</br>
in their harshness,</br>
proves that they do. Time, recoil I tell you!</br>
For I am the acerbic scent</br>
of memory!"</br>

Time, by this point all gloaming discarded,</br>
all bluster disbanded, all strength leeched,</br>
nothing more than a shade of a shade,</br>
a thread spooling off an old cloak,</br>
begs for mercy. Soap smiles and, finally, sweetly, says:</br>
"Time, you have met your match; I am sudsy!"</br>
