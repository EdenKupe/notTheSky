title: A Brief Report on the Outside

Well, first, it's cold.</br>
The kind of bitter cold that</br>
puts the faux-marmoreal precision</br>
of Celsius and Fahrenheit to shame,</br>
making them look like two well intentioned fools</br>
trying to dissect the cold as it slices through</br>
your skin.</br>

Then, secondly, the black ice is gone,</br>
thank God, taken away by the flurry that</br>
refreshed the snow. The dog glides over it</br>
so that, almost, for a second,</br>
I can forget that time passes.</br>

Lastly, space is still an inadequate category</br>
to describe how it feels to be situated</br>
in relation to so many things and places</br>
throughout this life.</br>
Walking streets is still mainly an exercise in memory</br>
more than it is any physical thing.</br>

That's my brief report which I wrote</br>
in my head while still learning how to be here.</br>
The dull ache shifts and turns inside of me and</br>
is unborn with each passing day.</br>
Perhaps eventually it will complete its untransformation,</br>
from an active, crying thing, back into a zygote.</br>
I hope you are well and that your day was good,</br>
apologies that the report is so brief.</br>
I would write more but it's too cold</br>
and I'm worried about the dull baby</br>
waking into grief.</br>

P.S I love you and miss you.</br>
