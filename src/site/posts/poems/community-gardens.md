When the great library burned
we lost many secrets. For example,
a diadem of formulas which,
when resolved correctly,
give an answer to the question
"why must children suffer"?

Alongside this was lost
the true map of the world. This map shows that
the world is not smooth at all,
as modern day "experts" would let you believe,
but perforated
drilled with holes
honeycombed
by community gardens.

Each walled off rectangle
of effort, sweat, and care
runs a line through the fabric of reality itself
and does it easily. The sheer amount of love and thought
and yes, bickering and pettiness and envy,
weighs on the weave of things
until it snaps.

In the great library,
which burned yesterday and thousands of years ago,
there was also a dusty, small tome,
containing a guide for traversing these green tunnels.
Luckily, it is easy to recover its contents, and I have,
they contained a single word,
imprinted on each of its three hundred and sixty seven pages,
"memory".
