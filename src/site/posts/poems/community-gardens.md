When the great library burned</br>
we lost many secrets. For example,</br>
a diadem of formulas which,</br>
when resolved correctly,</br>
give an answer to the question</br>
"why must children suffer"?</br>

Alongside this was lost</br>
the true map of the world. This map shows that</br>
the world is not smooth at all,</br>
as modern day "experts" would let you believe,</br>
but perforated</br>
drilled with holes</br>
honeycombed</br>
by community gardens.</br>

Each walled off rectangle</br>
of effort, sweat, and care</br>
runs a line through the fabric of reality itself</br>
and does it easily. The sheer amount of love and thought</br>
and yes, bickering and pettiness and envy,</br>
weighs on the weave of things</br>
until it snaps.</br>

In the great library,</br>
which burned yesterday and thousands of years ago,</br>
there was also a dusty, small tome,</br>
containing a guide for traversing these green tunnels.</br>
Luckily, it is easy to recover its contents, and I have,</br>
they contained a single word,</br>
imprinted on each of its three hundred and sixty seven pages,</br>
"memory".</br>
