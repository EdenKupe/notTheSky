title: That Is My Search
date: 2013-04-28

To say that I am accosted by
the blades that flicker as
they attempt to end my
thoughts
Would be a folly.

To say that I am troubled by
the cannons that sound as
they attempt to shatter my
resolve
Would be a mistake.

To say that I am distorted by
the null-lamps that un-shine as
they seek to thwart my
pilgrimage
Would be an error.

Instead say that I am charged by
the swords and cannons and null-lamps
that cry as my heart releases
energy during this
Folly/Mistake/Error

That is my search.
