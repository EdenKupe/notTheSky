What did he mean, "the body electric",</br>
that old poet, as if canals</br>
of blood and plasm</br>
suddenly carried lightning?</br>
As if, dragged, embedded, dredged</br>,
bodily parts somehow flittered,</br>
aloof,</br>
disconnected,</br>
trailing up above the world,</br>
like so many trails of smoke,</br>
and not as they are, grounded, foundational,</br>
dirt-bound.</br>

I sing the body aquatic!</br>
And do away with that old poet's speech,</br>
of corruption and defilement.</br>
I sing the body dying, and decaying,</br>
and real, and mottled,</br>
and patched, and dusted,</br>
with the mud of living, the refuge of time,</br>
the roots of existing, the muck of love,</br>
the bruises of reciprocity, the hickeys of god,</br>
the blood of ages, the regolith of life.</br>
