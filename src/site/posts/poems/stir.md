Work yourself into a froth; really get in there with
a spatula or other emotional crutch and *stir*. It's
not a wound if you're not picking at it, right? Scabs
are the only indication that you're feeling something.

Don't forget to get riled up; really go to town with
a flag or other emotional crutch and *stir*. It's
not a scab if you don't peel it off, right? Fresh sores
are the only indication that you're feeling something.

Please make sure to exaggerate; really lose touch with
a tombstone or other emotional crutch and *stir*. It's
not a scar if you don't constantly remember it right? Puckered flesh
is the only indication that you're still feeling something.
