She wears her boots one at a time
but she is also made of stars and
there is only so much contradiction my mind
can take.
However, I find that diving and swimming at the same time;
an elixirious emotion that is both para and intra dox;
is both the banishment and the conjuration.

She speaks alphabet one letter at a time
but she is also the effervescent mist and
there is only so much primal words my mind
can speak.
However, I find that dying and living at the same time;
a panacea of feeling that is both extra and sub mens;
is both the sending away and the beckoning.

She puts her coat on one button at a time
but she is also the end and the beginning and
there is only so much cosmic eons my mind
can traverse.
However, I find that asphyxiating and breathing at the same time;
a hybrid of mentality that is both inside and outside chronology;
is both the unfolding and the locking

of my heart.
