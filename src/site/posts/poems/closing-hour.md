closing hour at the local;
still life of a bowl of lemons;
the curve of the water jugs,
pewter and clay, sound and silence
resound on the unvarnished wood

waning evening simmer;
remembered fog caressing asphalt;
the windows let in sonorous light,
glass and steel, past and present
refract across the varnished wood

pulsing night over the city;
sable breath threading lawns;
the brownstone duly glimmers,
brick and lumber, dream and vision
play on the varnished wood
