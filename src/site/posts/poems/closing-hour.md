closing hour at the local;</br>
still life of a bowl of lemons;</br>
the curve of the water jugs,</br>
pewter and clay, sound and silence</br>
resound on the unvarnished wood</br>

waning evening simmer;</br>
remembered fog caressing asphalt;</br>
the windows let in sonorous light,</br>
glass and steel, past and present</br>
refract across the varnished wood</br>

pulsing night over the city;</br>
sable breath threading lawns;</br>
the brownstone duly glimmers,</br>
brick and lumber, dream and vision</br>
play on the varnished wood</br>
