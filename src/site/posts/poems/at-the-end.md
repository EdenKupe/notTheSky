Here, at the end,</br>
there's a fire that</br>
sussurates and fizzles</br>
with oxygen</br>
and the smoke rises</br>
up</br>
and</br>
up</br>
all the way up</br>
until the very sky</br>
is smothered.</br>

Here, at the end,</br>
corn sweats</br>
and the air is filled</br>
with a vegetative heat</br>
a wondering</br>
a threatening</br>
a potential</br>
an embrace.</br>

Here, at the end,</br>
hearts all glow</br>
arms reach out</br>
and find purchase</br>
here, at the end, they</br>
find home, score target,</br>
hit jackpot, carve bullseye.</br>

Here, at the end,</br>
I miss you</br>
and the versions of who</br>
we might have been</br>
and summer heats</br>
gone</br>
and winter chills</br>
gone</br>
And spring</br>
