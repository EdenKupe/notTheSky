Here, at the end,
there's a fire that
sussurates and fizzles
with oxygen 
and the smoke rises
up
and
up
all the way up
until the very sky
is smothered.

Here, at the end,
corn sweats
and the air is filled
with a vegetative heat
a wondering
a threatening
a potential
an embrace.

Here, at the end,
hearts all glow
arms reach out
and find purchase
here, at the end, they
find home, score target,
hit jackpot, carve bullseye.

Here, at the end,
I miss you
and the versions of who
we might have been
and summer heats
gone
and winter chills
gone
And spring
