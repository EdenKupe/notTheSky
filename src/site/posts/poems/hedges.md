On our first spring here,<br>
a rabbit with a broken leg<br>
struck up camp in our hedges.<br>
He felt like a metaphor<br>
but for what<br>
I haven't quite figured out yet.<br>

From the hill where we live<br>
you can hear the downtown trucks<br>
rumbling.<br>
They sound like their bellies are full of fire<br>
and the asphalt has told them some great joke<br>
about the sky, probably.<br>

Each day that we stay here<br>
the past seems less clear to me<br>
like a sudsy island floating away<br>
on a river.<br>

Maybe I don't have to make sense of it<br>
to pull back together the sequences of its birth<br>
the swirl, the churn, the bubbling up of it all,<br>
but rather let it, and me, be how it is<br>
like a rabbit with a broken leg<br>
making space in the hedges.<br>
