did you ever stop to think</br>
how amazing it is that</br>
there are so many places; an</br>
infinity of places, really.</br>

like, when I was twisting with worry</br>
in tel aviv</br>
this recycling bin was here</br>
stoat by the elevator</br>
and the oft-abused ice machine.</br>

and now, even as my back hurts and</br>
i watch the cormorant dry his wings,</br>
future places wait for me and</br>
a breeze runs through them.</br>

it gets better when you</br>
count the flowers, not to mention</br>
the people</br>
the people and their many forms</br>
and quirks and routines</br>
and hopes.</br>

we are blessed to exist in multitudes</br>
bounties of perspectives and</br>
bifurcating dreams.</br>
