did you ever stop to think
how amazing it is that
there are so many places; an
infinity of places, really.

like, when I was twisting with worry
in tel aviv
this recycling bin was here
stoat by the elevator
and the oft-abused ice machine.

and now, even as my back hurts and
i watch the cormorant dry his wings,
future places wait for me and
a breeze runs through them.

it gets better when you
count the flowers, not to mention
the people
the people and their many forms
and quirks and routines
and hopes.

we are blessed to exist in multitudes
bounties of perspectives and
bifurcating dreams.
