There's a soft ping from Tohil as the weather satellite completes its orbit and passes above High Camp. I'm not sure why it's the only satellite I have named so far; it has 27 brothers and sisters, circling HP3019. The irony of the fact that I've named the satellite before I've named the planet on which I've been residing for the past six months is not lost on me. However, as important as Tohil is to my life here on HP3019, naming the planet itself feels more *final* than naming a piece of metal floating around in orbit. If I'm being honest, and this is a journal that I think no one else will *ever* read so there's no reason *not* to be honest, I'm still not sure if I want to stay here. No one could blame me, I don't think; HP3019 has its charms but they're all buried under the rain. Perhaps "buried" is a bit too extreme. Obscured? Veiled? One of those adjectives.

Even now, when Tohil and its cohort tell me that the storm I have been suffering under for the past two weeks has abated, there is constant rain. There's just not a constant *deluge* of rain coupled with harrowing winds as I had experienced for those stormy two weeks. To be honest, I still can't believe I made it out alive or that the camp is in one piece. High Camp fits its boring name to a tee; nestled between an outcrop of rock and the side of Peak 2918 (another place I hadn't gotten around to naming yet), I expected the camp to be sheltered from the worst of the storms. That was when I had just landed here and the full impact of the lackluster "severe presence of hydration" that graced all reports about HP3019, as limited as they were, hadn't yet presented itself to me. By now, I was more learned. Severe was an understatment. But I don't blame whoever wrote that report: any word would have been an understatment, regardless of how superlative and melodramatic it might seem.

I can still hear the howling of that bastard, frigid wind even now. Perhaps it is echoed in these less severe gusts that are still all around me. They are nothing like their parent; building up behind Peak 2918, the winds that came crashing down on me two weeks ago were one of those weather events that make you question your atheism. I'm sure many such events are sure to come. Tohil pings again, saying its "goodbye" as it continues on its orbit, away from direct comms with High Camp, as if to remind me that gods are all around me. Yes, yes, my dear satellite, I understand. I understand even better now, having survived my first proper storm on HP3019, how a human might come to need an explanation for the forces crashing around them when those forces are so...*palpable*. Everything on this planet, with its non-stopping water falling from the sky, makes a heaven seem as close as I've felt it, the arch of the sky somehow tighter, more present. Perhaps when something is constantly falling from it, be it a watery something or otherwise, you are more often reminded of how small you are in relation to it.

Or something, I don't know. The homegrown alcohol I've been making up here in combination with the high altitude is making me ramble. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this journal; it's unlikely anyone will read it. Don't get me wrong, I full expect to publish it. I'm not going to die on this planet. This isn't one of *those* colonies. No, I just think no one will be interested in it. I've been here for six months, with 28 satellites in orbit, and I've found absolutely nothing beyond endless lochs, valleys, mountains, seas, and more mountains. Sure, it's all very pretty; flora on HP3019 has adapted to the constant rainfall, undulating outwards in rhizomatic structures which cover entire mountain ranges in thick, rich grass. Hell, if you leave anything out for an hour or so in the rain, you'll probably come back to find it covered in growth. *Verdant* is the word I'm looking for. Maybe even *fecund*, though the rain makes this place much cleaner and more coldly clean than that word might suggest. There are no swamps here that I can see; only waterfalls, and rivers, and scree, and mountainside, and cloud cover, and wind, so much wind and rain and

Right. The alcohol is definitely kicking in (I made it from the fruit of a tree that grows in the area of High Camp. It's an acquired taste to say the least). Maybe a more sterlie style of writing will help me stay on course here. So, as I said, flora: plentiful. Fauna: none so far (and what a disappointment that is). Minerals: negligible deposits of iron and copper in some of the mountain ranges. Exotic materials: none.
