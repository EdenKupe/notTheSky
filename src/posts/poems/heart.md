Do you know how to
look far into hazy skylines and
long for home at the same time?
Lines are drawn before the gentle
mind, leading towards a fresh, familiar
Heart.

Do you know how to
sing with joy for new images and
smile with bliss at cherished hearths?
Soft paths are drawn before the eager
mind, leading towards a newborn, ancient
Heart.

Do you know how to
forge a song gilt with lyric words and
keep silent before an intrinsic truth?
Silver gylphs are painted before the supple
mind, leading towards a budding, sagelike
Heart.
