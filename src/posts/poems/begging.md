There is a place
where the winds cross
themselves. Lost in the corner,
I weep forever,
begging.

This is a place
where I have never
been. Yet in a soul's corner
I weep forever,
begging to return.

My tears fall blind
on the figure that stands.
Above me he holds
a clockwork chime
and my year soaked blanket
folds.

This is a place
where I have always
been. Yet in a soul's corner
I weep forever,
begging to return.

There is a place
where the winds cross
my heart. Found in the corner,
I weep forever,
begging.
