Napping; and shelaughing hovers in the boundaries
of my recognition. A soft laugh transports me, translates me
into a bird of my own desire, to a softer land of blue and white where
driftingtogether a blueberry flavored cloud graces a periwinkle sky and the treesconnected sing a hymn.

Falling; and shemaking sits on the edges
of my inwards vision. A dancing now sends me, transforms me
into a silent pool of water, away to mirthful hills of green and brown where
a stillsilent valley leads jubilant laughter towards a roaring, cerulean sea and the wavesembracing conduct a choir.

Returning; and sheliving stands in the middle
of my present being. A wistful smile now moves me, forges me
into a flowing rivulet of gold, to a placid plain of argent and wine where
the selfeloping herds prancing dreams towards a waiting, nocturnal gate and the heartascendant chants a song.
