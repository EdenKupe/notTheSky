In these early hours
hone well your edge, your muscles flex
against the privations
of the latter day hex.

Ensorcelled masses preach;
to wounded souls the pastors teach
the path of self neglect.

In the early watch
light fierce the torch, wear a mask,
that does not corrode,
against the illusion
of the less-taken road.

Ensorcelled masses preach;
to wounded souls the pastors teach
the path of self-denial.

Before the day
pray not for dawn, fear the light
that with hate condones
the small compassion
of a warm night.
