And so she told him, release me.
He asks her where she'll go once
the flickering of his eager hands
send her back. Smiling, eyes
heavily shrouded by emotion,
she opens her mouth to reply.
I'll shatter like an effigy made of drops.

And so he told her, release me.
She asks him how he'll be once
the earthen ties of her eager smile
recede with her. Lying, eyes
lightly betraying his emotion,
he opens his mouth to reply.
I'll shatter like a silent dancer in the sky.

And so they tell themselves, release us.
They ask what will come now once
the ditches of our eager road
fade against the horizon. Hoping, eyes
separate the two in their hearts,
each opens his/her mouth to reply.
They'll sing again with the distance;
he, with a cry
she, with a sigh.
