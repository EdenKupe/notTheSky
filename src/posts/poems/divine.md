Weathered eyes attempt to emblaze
the stars on the peak that is ascending
before them.
Pregnant tears, born of weary years,
are cast from the pale blue of the pupils,
to founder on calloused feet.

Fading lips mumble a broken tune
to the stars on the peak that is ascending
before them.
Shattered thoughts, struck by the ticking of minutes,
tumble from the brittle brown lashes,
to scatter on scabbed knees.

Broken backs sketch an edgy bow
to the stars on the peak that is ascending
before them.
Drowning words, sunk by the beatings at heart,
fail to  say "to weep is human,
to die, divine".
