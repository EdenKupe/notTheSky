She talks and he hears her
in the heart of him.
Across the breach of the living world
he smiles at her.

She sighs and he flies to her
in the heart of him.
Across the torrent of the dying past
he circles her.

She cries and he embraces her
in the heart of him.
Across the drifting of the coming future
he holds her.

She laughs and he finds her.
She becomes, the heart of him.
Across eternal bells
he lives her.
