Why surprise
all feeler? Shouldn't
wonder take the place of
the most unbecoming shape
your mouth has become in light
of this revelation?

Why recoil
all knower? Wouldn't
joy be more becoming of
the most incandescent idea
your mind has told in the light
of this empathy?

Why deny
all predicter? Couldn't
love cement embracing of
the most singular realization
of this message?

When your facade fails;
feeling, knowing, predicting
will all drown in
a sea of tears that
never ends, ever-flowing
from your mind, all knower,
all feeler, all predicter allow me to
hug you.
