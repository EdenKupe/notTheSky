Imagine if you were granted your wish;
reality is now thought, mixing like a
gushing elixir, silver and satin, iron and fire
words and objects, reality and thought.

Imagine if you had what you wanted;
emotions are now language, speaking like a
burning monk, smoke and wood, pebbles and water
feelings and vessels, emotion and language.

Imagine if your dream came to be;
others are now I, merging like a
threading river, bank and stream, sky and coast
strangers and home, others and I.

Imagine if what I needed happened;
silence is now home, quieting like a
winding wind, smile and gaze, lips and touch
peace and safety, silence and home.
