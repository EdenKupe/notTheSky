Sought, the river breathes
but I fear its embrace.
I have called it, with my pain
but I fear its embrace.
I have bled it, with my smile
but I fear its embrace.

There are others here;
they call to me with lyrics
smelted in silver.
They adorn their chests
echoed emblems, life-born
symmetries, of hearts.

Sought, the river sings
but I fear its embrace.
I have held it, with my shame
but I fear its embrace.
I have drank it, with my tears
but I fear its embrace.

The others here;
they call to me with lyrics
born in gold.
They writhe on their chests,
remembered symbols, birth-born
codices, of hearts.

Flooding, the river comes
but I fear its embrace.
It is nearing, to my name
but I fear its embrace.
It will hold me, to my deeds
but I fear its embrace.

The others here;
they will rescue me
but I fear their embrace.
