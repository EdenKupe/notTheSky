I am shards that
are split into notes.
Silver sleeps beneath
the monochrome.

Softly borne of
threaded bones,
my memory unveils
un-truth.

I am streams that
converge into a song.
Fire wakes beneath
the monochrome.

Violently borne of
forgotten homes,
my franticness upends
the earth.

I am fields that
run into a home.
Silence waits inside
the monochrome.
