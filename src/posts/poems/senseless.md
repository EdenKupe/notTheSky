In a midst the crowd, she is
all the walls and all the time
contained there in.
I move in a silken daze, begotten
of all she is,
senseless.

So much white
inside her eyes and without,
the room is held.
I breathe in a silken haze, begotten
of all that could be,
senseless.

There is glass
and silence
and pain, in what she is.
I struggle in a silken maze, to contain
all that I feel,
caught in her moment,
senseless.
