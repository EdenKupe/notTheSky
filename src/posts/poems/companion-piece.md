She
doesn't wipe away her tears until they
have finished flowing. Brimmed with her emotions they
softly carve an endless seeking into
her cheeks and I smile for
born today; tonight if I am honest; born again
if I am frank, I love her.

don't quite know what to say until they
have finished flowing. Lined with my emotions they
silkenly lead an endless circle into
my thoughts and she smiles for
born today; tonight if she is honest; born again
if I am frank, she loves me.
