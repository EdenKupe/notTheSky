title: In Weaving Find

Seek and
in seeking turn
swiftly around;
draw from your
cartilage scabbard a
broken sword and
in drawing strike
Swiftly down;
shatter tightly clenched
arterial chains forged
from mithril fears and
in forging hold
All you are;
tether swiftly escaping
guttural dreams weaved
in gossamer fears and
in weaving find
A measure of peace;
anoint fast decaying
cerebral hopes masticated
from digested pain and
present them for
the world to destroy.
